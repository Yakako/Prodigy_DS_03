# Task-03: Customer Purchase Prediction Using Decision Tree Classifier
---

# Project Overview

This project implements a Decision Tree Classifier to predict whether a customer will purchase a product or service based on their demographic and behavioral data. The model helps businesses target potential customers more effectively by analyzing patterns in customer behavior.
- The dataset used for this project is the Bank Marketing dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# 🚀 Objective
Predict if a customer will subscribe to a bank product or service.
Analyze the influence of demographic and behavioral features on customer purchase decisions.
Build an interpretable model that can provide insights for marketing strategies.

# 📂 Dataset
Bank Marketing Dataset:
Contains attributes related to customer information (age, job, marital status, education, etc.), contact information, and past interactions.
Target variable: y — whether the client subscribed to a term deposit (yes or no).

# 📈 Methodology
1. Data Preprocessing
- Handle missing values
- Encode categorical features
- Scale/normalize numerical features if needed
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize feature distributions
- Check class balance in the target variable
- Explore correlations and feature importance
3. Model Building
- Split data into training and testing sets
- Train a Decision Tree Classifier
- Optimize hyperparameters using GridSearchCV or cross-validation
4. Model Evaluation
- Confusion Matrix
- Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- ROC-AUC curve for classification performance
5. Interpretation
- Visualize the decision tree
- Analyze feature importance to understand key drivers of customer purchase decisions
